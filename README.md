# Traveler's Tales : Venture-Beyond

## Description

Traveler's Tales aims to provide an rpg experience following a medieval theme

### Features

- Combat will never be the same with the EpicFight mod. You'll have to time your attacks and dodges as well as find the weapon type that suits you to slay your foes

- Training will be key to master the skills you might need like combat, woodcutting, mining and so on. Each skill granting related bonuses

- Magic is in here ! Mods like Mahou Tsukai and Botania will make the adventure much more... well... magic. (We plan in hopefully adding Ars Nouveau to the pack if we can without it breaking forge version dependencies)

- Explore a world filled with friendly encounters, and others who will only get you good old punches in the face. A lot of structures to explore, loot and exploit, wildlife to meet, as well as beautiful caves

- Many quality-of-life improvments like double door opening, healing campfires, inventory sorting, backpacks, sleeping bags and much more
